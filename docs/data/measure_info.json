Raw data observations are generally per county/city; however, some observations involve multiple counties/cities. For example, Fairfax County, Fairfax City and Falls Church City are grouped into one observation in the raw data.  We split the multi-county/city raw data observations into multiple observations so that one observation corresponds to only one county/city.  We set the value of each split individual observation to be that of the corresponding raw multi-county/city observation.\n\nThese are the multi-county/city groupings in the raw data: Albemarle County, Charlottesville; Alleghany County, Covington; Augusta County, Staunton, Waynesboro; Campbell County,  Lynchburg; Carroll County, Galax; Dinwiddie County, Colonial Heights, Petersburg; Fairfax County, Fairfax City, Falls Church; Frederick County, Winchester; Greensville County, Emporia; Henry County,  Martinsville; James City County, Williamsburg; Montgomery County, Radford; Pittsylvania County, Danville; Prince George County, Hopewell; Prince William County, Manassas, Manassas Park; Roanoke County, Salem; Rockbridge County, Buena Vista, Lexington; Rockingham County, Harrisonburg; Southampton County, Franklin; Spotsylvania County, Fredericksburg; Washington County, Bristol; Wise County, Norton; York County, Poquoson.",
