    "long_description": "The Affordability index is developed to measure the proportion of income spent on housing and transportation. The affordability index is obtained from the Housing + Transportation (H+T) Affordability Index data provided by Center for Neighborhood Technology (CNT). The index of affordability is calculated by combining housing and transportation costs in a neighborhood and dividing that number by income . H+T index provides three different affordability index to account for different households like Regional Typical Household, Regional Moderate Household and National Typical Household. In our analysis, we focused on the Regional Typical Household. \n We downloaded and cleaned the dataset from the CNT H+T index website for years 2015, 2019, and 2020.  To fill in the missing data for the years 2016-2018, we performed interpolation using the available data points from 2015 and 2019. Additionally, for the year 2021, we estimated employment access values by multiplying the rate of change observed from 2019 to 2020 by the values for the year 2020. Employment access data is available at the tract, county and health district level for the state of Virginia.",

The employment access index is obtained from the Housing + Transportation (H+T) Affordability Index data provided by Center for Neighborhood Technology (CNT).  H+T calculated the index using a gravity model. The index is calculated by summing the total number of jobs divided by the square of the distance to those jobs. The index is based on jobs and distance decay function. \n We downloaded and cleaned the dataset from the CNT H+T index website for years 2015, 2019, and 2020. To fill in the missing data for the years 2016-2018, we performed interpolation using the available data points from 2015 and 2019. Additionally, for the year 2021, we estimated employment access values by multiplying the rate of change observed from 2019 to 2020 by the values for the year 2020. Employment access data is available at the tract, county and health district level for the state of Virginia.",
