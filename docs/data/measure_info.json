The affordability index is obtained from the Housing + Transportation (H+T) Affordability Index data provided by Center for Neighborhood Technology (CNT). The index of affordability is calculated by combining housing and transportation costs in a neighborhood and dividing that number by income . H+T index provides three different affordability index to account for different households like Regional Typical Household, Regional Moderate Household and National Typical Household. In our analysis, we focused on the Regional Typical Household. \n We downloaded and cleaned the dataset from the CNT H+T index website for years 2015, 2019, and 2020.  To fill in the missing data for the years 2016-2018, we performed interpolation using the available data points from 2015 and 2019. Additionally, for the year 2021, we estimated employment access values by multiplying the rate of change observed from 2019 to 2020 by the values for the year 2020. Employment access data is available at the tract, county and health district level for the state of Virginia.",

Wages and salaries refer to the monetary remuneration of employees; it includes compensation of corporate officers; commissions, tips, and bonuses, compensation plans, such as 401(k) plans; and receipts in kind, or pay-in-kind, that represent income to the recipient. Supplements to wages and salaries consists of employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds and employer contributions for government social insurance. Proprietor’s income is the current-production income (including the income in kind) of sole proprietorships and partnerships and of tax-exempt cooperatives.\n\nRaw data observations are generally per county/city; however, some observations involve multiple counties/cities. For example, Fairfax County, Fairfax City and Falls Church City are grouped into one observation in the raw data.  We split the multi-county/city raw data observations into multiple observations so that one observation corresponds to only one county/city.  We set the value of each split individual observation to be that of the corresponding raw multi-county/city observation.\n\nThese are the multi-county/city groupings in the raw data: Albemarle County, Charlottesville; Alleghany County, Covington; Augusta County, Staunton, Waynesboro; Campbell County,  Lynchburg; Carroll County, Galax; Dinwiddie County, Colonial Heights, Petersburg; Fairfax County, Fairfax City, Falls Church; Frederick County, Winchester; Greensville County, Emporia; Henry County,  Martinsville; James City County, Williamsburg; Montgomery County, Radford; Pittsylvania County, Danville; Prince George County, Hopewell; Prince William County, Manassas, Manassas Park; Roanoke County, Salem; Rockbridge County, Buena Vista, Lexington; Rockingham County, Harrisonburg; Southampton County, Franklin; Spotsylvania County, Fredericksburg; Washington County, Bristol; Wise County, Norton; York County, Poquoson.",

Poor job access can include barriers such as distance from residents and transportation availability.

H+T calculated the index using a gravity model. The index is calculated by summing the total number of jobs divided by the square of the distance to those jobs. The index is based on jobs and distance decay function. \n We downloaded and cleaned the dataset from the CNT H+T index website for years 2015, 2019, and 2020. To fill in the missing data for the years 2016-2018, we performed interpolation using the available data points from 2015 and 2019. Additionally, for the year 2021, we estimated employment access values by multiplying the rate of change observed from 2019 to 2020 by the values for the year 2020.
